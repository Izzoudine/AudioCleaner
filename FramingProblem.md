# 📱🎧 Noise Reduction App

## 📘 Project Comprehension and Context

This project aims to develop both a **mobile** and a **web application** that connects to a **noise reduction model**. The core functionality allows users to clean noisy audio or video content by reducing or modifying background noise and adjusting voice clarity.

Users will have control to **increase or decrease both the noise and the voice dynamically**, according to their preference.

The application is designed for **global accessibility**, helping anyone improve the sound quality of:
- Voice memos
- Interviews
- Podcasts
- Videos

---

## ❗ Problem to Resolve

Many people worldwide encounter audio recordings or videos with disruptive background noise. This significantly reduces the usability and enjoyment of the content.

This app aims to solve that problem by:
- ✅ Providing **clean, noise-reduced audio**
- ✅ Allowing **noise and voice level adjustments**
- ✅ Making **advanced noise reduction accessible** without professional tools

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives

### 🆓 Freemium Launch Strategy
- The **mobile app** will be **free to use** for a limited time.
- Users will **watch ads** to unlock or perform noise-cleaning operations.

### 💸 Monetization Plan (Future Stages)
- Offer **premium subscriptions** to remove ads
- Add **credit-based or pay-per-use** noise cleaning
- Introduce **cloud-based or offline processing** tiers

### 📈 User Growth and Retention
- Provide **free access** to lower the entry barrier
- Encourage sharing through **high-quality, quick results**
- Convert free users to **loyal premium users**

### 🎯 Model Evaluation Metrics

To assess the performance of the noise reduction model, we selected metrics specifically suited for signal enhancement tasks, combining both objective and perceptual evaluations.

#### 📶 Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
**SNR** measures the proportion of **signal power** relative to **noise power** in the audio.  
A higher SNR indicates that the model has effectively reduced the noise while preserving the original signal.  
> 🔍 **Interpretation**: The higher the SNR after processing, the better the quality of the cleaned signal.

#### 🗣️ Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ)
**PESQ** is a standardized metric for evaluating the **perceived quality of speech** after processing, based on the **intelligibility** and **fidelity** of the signal.  
It provides a score that closely reflects how a human would perceive the audio quality.
> 🎧 **Use case**: Widely used in telecommunications and speech enhancement applications.

#### 🧠 Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI)
**STOI** measures the **intelligibility of speech** in processed audio signals.  
It ensures that speech remains understandable after noise has been removed.
> 🎯 **Best for**: Applications where speech clarity is crucial, such as voice assistants, transcription, and communication systems.
