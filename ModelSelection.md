### ðŸ§  Learning Approach

The model uses a **Transfer Learning** strategy, leveraging powerful pre-trained models such as **Demucs**, **DeepFilterNet**, and **RNNoise**.  
This approach allows us to:
- Avoid the need for large labeled datasets
- Benefit from strong baseline performance
- Accelerate training with high starting accuracy

# Audio Noise Reduction Models Comparison

## Demucs
- **Focus:** Originally for music source separation, excellent for general noise reduction
- **Strengths:** Highest quality separation, handles complex noise, MIT license
- **Limitations:** Computationally intensive, larger model size
- **Best for:** Projects where quality is the top priority

## DeepFilterNet
- **Focus:** Speech enhancement and noise suppression
- **Strengths:** Natural sound preservation, good balance of quality/efficiency
- **Limitations:** Less effective on non-speech audio
- **Best for:** Voice recordings, podcasts, and interviews

## RNNoise
- **Focus:** Real-time voice noise reduction
- **Strengths:** Extremely lightweight, low latency, runs on minimal hardware
- **Limitations:** Lower quality than larger models, voice-specific
- **Best for:** Real-time applications, mobile devices, live communication

Choose **Demucs** for highest quality, **DeepFilterNet** for balanced performance, or **RNNoise** for efficiency and real-time use.
